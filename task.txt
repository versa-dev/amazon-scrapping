I have a list of products to be uploaded to a woocommerce store. These products require product images and product descriptions.

Your job is to scrape a number of websites like Amazon (list to be provided) and find images and descriptions for each product.

You'll upload the images to a Wordpress site ensuring the file names match the product names. You'll then add the Wordpress image URL to the sheet with the corresponding product.
